The Twitter modules automatically mirrors selected zephyrs to your
personal class to your twitter feed.

To configure it, first

* Add your twitter credentials to ~/.owl/twitter as a JSON hash, e.g.
{"user":"nelhage", "password":"sekrit" }
* Load the modules
* Set the twitter:class, twitter:instance, and twitter:opcode
  variables to the destination you want messages to be mirrored
  from. By default, they are -c $YOUR_USERNAME -i status -O twitter
  Setting twitter:opcode to "" will cause "normal" (i.e. no opcode)
  messages to that class/instance to be mirrored. A value of '*'
  works as a "match-anything" wildcard for any of the fields.
