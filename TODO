barn-owl TODO list
------------------

1) Basic Jabber functionality
 * MUST   default style
 * MUST   option to accept/deny sub requests
  * better UI?
 * MUST   MUC presence
 * SHOULD shortname support
 * MUST   think about priority & status
 * multi-user chat
   * MAY  More extensive room configuration
* Default domain for JIDs
 * (e.g. jwrite nelhage should DTRT. I'd like jmuc join help to also.)
* Check for memory leaks
 * perl eval()s from owl seem problematic
* Add sane default keybindings
* Add jabber capabilities to one-line mode
* We should work even when zephyr is not available
