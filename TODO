barn-owl TODO list
------------------

* MUC presence info
* Proper Jabber logging
* Roster management
 * Adding and removing contacts
 * Approving/rejecting sub requests
* Default domain for JIDs
 * (e.g. jwrite nelhage should DTRT. I'd like jmuc join help to also.)
* Make the default display work with Jabber
* Make filters work with Jabber
* smartnarrow should be jabber-aware
* Check for memory leaks
 * perl eval()s from owl seem problematic
* Add sane default keybindings
* Add jabber capabilities to one-line mode
* We should work even when zephyr is not available
