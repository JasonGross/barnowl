The Twitter module implements Twitter support for BarnOwl. It also
supports automatic mirroring of some subset of Zephyrs you send to
Twitter.

To configure it, first

* Add your twitter credentials to ~/.owl/twitter as a JSON hash, e.g.
{"user":"nelhage", "password":"sekrit" }
* Load the module (cp Twitter.par into ~/.owl/modules and :reload-module Twitter)
* Set the twitter:class, twitter:instance, and twitter:opcode
  variables to the destination you want messages to be mirrored
  from. By default, they are -c $YOUR_USERNAME -i status -O twitter
  Setting twitter:opcode to "" will cause "normal" (i.e. no opcode)
  messages to that class/instance to be mirrored. A value of '*'
  works as a "match-anything" wildcard for any of the fields.

Twitter.par will also receive twitters and inject them into barnowl as
messages of type 'twitter'. It polls for normal messages once a
minute, and direct messages every other minute. To disable polling,
you can unset the 'twitter:poll' variable in BarnOwl.

Twitter.par now supports other Twitter-compatible microblogging
services, like identi.ca. To enable this, set the 'service' parameter
in your config hash to the API URL of your service. You will likely
also need to set 'apihost' and 'apirealm'. See Net::Twitter or your
blogging service's documentation for more information.

Twitter.par also supports using multiple Twitter and Twitter-compatible
microblogging accounts from the same instance.  To enable this, add 
additional hashes to your ~/.owl/twitter file (wrapped in a JSON list,
eg. [{"account_nickname":"twitter","user":"nelhage","password":"sekrit"},
{"account_nickname":"identica","service":"http://identi.ca/api",
"user":"nelhage","password":"sekriter"}]

By default, public messages (excluding at-replies) are sent to all 
accounts listed except those with publish_tweets set to false.

There are several additional account-specific parameters that control the 
behavior of Twitter.par when using multiple accounts:

* account_nickname (string, required if multiple accounts are in use)
    Specify a short name by which you can refer to the account, eg.
    "identica" (eg. :twitter-direct nelhage identica would send a direct 
    message to @nelhage on identi.ca from your account nicknamed "identica").
* default_sender (boolean, default false)
    If true, direct messages and at-replies you send without specifying an
    account will be sent using this account.  If no account has this parameter,
    such messages will be sent using the first account listed.
* poll_for_tweets (boolean, default true)
    If true, tweets sent by your friends on this account will be displayed
    in your BarnOwl message list.
* poll_for_dms (boolean, default true)
    If true, Direct Messages sent to you by your friends on this account 
    will be displayed in your BarnOwl message list.
* publish_tweets (boolean, default true)
    If true, tweets you send without specifying an account (either with the 
    :twitter command or mirrored from a zephyr class) will be published to 
    this account.
