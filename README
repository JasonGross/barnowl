The Twitter modules automatically mirrors selected zephyrs to your
personal class to your twitter feed.

To configure it, first

* Add your twitter credentials to ~/.owl/twitter as a JSON hash, e.g.
{"user":"nelhage", "password":"sekrit" }
* Load the module
* Set the twitter:class, twitter:instance, and twitter:opcode
  variables to the destination you want messages to be mirrored
  from. By default, they are -c $YOUR_USERNAME -i status -O twitter
  Setting twitter:opcode to "" will cause "normal" (i.e. no opcode)
  messages to that class/instance to be mirrored. A value of '*'
  works as a "match-anything" wildcard for any of the fields.

As of Thanksgiving weekend 2008, Twitter.par will also receive
twitters and inject them into barnowl as messages of type
'twitter'. Currently, it polls every 45 seconds, and there's no way to
disable polling once loaded. There's also no direct message
support. Bug me if fixing any of these is important to you.
