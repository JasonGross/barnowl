barnowl TODO list
------------------

1) Basic Jabber functionality
 * MUST   think about priority & status
 * SHOULD Store list of muc rooms to join
   > .owl/startup is insufficient, since ideally you should autojoin
     them any time you :jabberlogin, not just at start.
 * MAY  More extensive room configuration
* Check for memory leaks
 * perl eval()s from owl seem problematic
* Add sane default keybindings
* Add jabber capabilities to one-line mode
* We should work well even when zephyr is not available
